# TaskHub
task board for tracking issues and tasks using a Taskcard design.

this is a sideproject that is meant to give me some insight into wpf and deeper understanding of events and delegates.

<b>so far I included:</b>
- a list of tasks, 
- a Grid View
- adding, deleting Tasks as well as updating (SQL DATABASE with simpe CRUD operations)
- checking and un checking tasks
- adding deleting Projects
- filter by project

any help and advice is allways welcome
